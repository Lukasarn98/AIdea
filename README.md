# Self driving shopping carts in stores

Building AI course project.

## Summary

AI-powered carts with sensors and small electric motors could autonomously steer themselves around the store, avoiding bottlenecks and politely pausing when space is tight. They’d communicate with each other to plan paths, just like self-driving cars in a city grid and the stores products would be marked so AI knows where to go. The shopper just sits back, relaxes and enjoys while the carts go do all the shopping. 



## Background

In today’s fast-paced world, grocery shopping remains one of those essential but time-consuming tasks that people often dread. While online delivery and pickup options have improved convenience, they still rely heavily on human labor, are prone to errors, and don't offer instant access to items. The AI-based grocery bot system addresses these limitations by transforming how in-store shopping is done.

Which problems does your idea solve?

Long wait times and crowded aisles during peak hours

Labor shortages in retail, especially for stocking and order fulfillment

Inefficient manual collection of items for pickup and delivery orders

## Why is it interesting

AI is always interesting.

## How is it used?

Shoppers place orders through an app -> AI-powered bots receive the order and navigate the aisles to collect the items.
-> AI coordinates the bots to avoid traffic jams and optimize efficiency.

Shoppers wait in a lounge area and receive their order once the bots finish.

## Challenges

Society is complex and unpredictable, there could be as with often trying to integrate AI into society, society is complex and unpredictable, maintance staff or fallen produce. They will also need energy and maintenance.

## Data and AI techniques

Computer Vision – detection, scanning, and navigation in the store.

Reinforcement Learning – train bots to make efficient movement decisions in real-time when unpredictability shows up.

Path Planning Algorithms – for route optimization in the store.

## Whats next

Even bigger system that dont even need people coming in to the stores, that could deliver to you.
